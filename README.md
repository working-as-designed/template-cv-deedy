## Resume Principles
- **Use consistent voice between longform resume updates**. It's nitpicky but ~obnoxious to endure. Rewrite it all if you have to, it pays dividends.
- Use your Resume to seed interview questions about your experiences. **You don't need to write a novel, just the opening hook**.
- A hiring manager will spend ~20 seconds looking at your resume, to inform a phonescreen decision, **no more than 1 page without a really good reason**.
- Flavor and styling are great but optional and can distract from the objective of the doc. **Be easily digestible yet memorable**.
- If an experience isn't contemporary and relevant to the role you're seeking, think on pruning it. **Does it spark joy?**.


## Environment Setup

1. Install a Latex distribution. This time, I went with the latest distribution from MacTeX (`.pkg` download)
1. Install LaTeX Workshop VSCode extension.
1. Configure the extension's recipe order to use `XeLaTeX`. This can be done by pressing `CMD + ,` and searching for `latex`. Dig around in that menu until you're editing JSON.

In these three easy steps, Bob was my uncle.

Deedy CV/Resume

Original description:
This Resume/CV template features a large header with your name and contact information clearly displayed. The Resume/CV content is then in a two-column layout which concentrates a large amount of information in a small space. This allows you to choose which aspects of your academic and professional life to focus on depending on their importance for the position you are applying for. Major sections and their subsections are strongly deviated to grab the attention of the hiring manager. Separate styles are present for past job titles and duration of employment to differentiate these from the descriptions of work performed. Lists of achievements, publications, society memberships, etc are also easy to create and provide a compact way to display a large amount of information.

The template is for a one page Resume/CV but includes code at the end for creating a second page with the same layout as the first one. You may wish to alternate the second page so the thinner column is on the right side for a varied appearance. The template uses two custom free fonts which come included: Lato and Raleway.

Important notes: this template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX. There should be a setting in your LaTeX distribution to change to XeLaTeX.
